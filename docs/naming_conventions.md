# General Principles

- **Naming Conventions**: Use snake_case.
- **Language**: English.
- **Avoid Reserved Words**: Do not use SQL reserved words as object names (Table, Schema, etc).

# Table Naming Convention

---

## Bronze Rules

- All names must start with the source system name, and table names must match their original names without renaming.
- `<sourcesystem>_<entity>`
    - `<sourcesystem>`: Name of the source system (e.g., `crm` , `erp`).
    - <entity>: Exact table name from the source system.
    - Example: `crm_customer_info` → Customer information from the CRM system.

## Silver Rules

- All names must start with the source system name, and table names must match their original names without renaming.
- `<sourcesystem>_<entity>`
    - `<sourcesystem>`: Name of the source system (e.g., `crm` , `erp`).
    - `<entity>`: Exact table name from the source system.
    - Example: `crm_customer_info` → Customer information from the CRM system.

## Gold Rules

- All names must use meaningful, business-aligned names for tables, starting with the category prefix.
- `<category>_<entity>`
    - `<category>`: Describe the role of the table, such as dim (dimension) or fact (fact table)
    - `<entity>`: Descriptive name of the table, aligned with the business domain (e.g., `customers`, `products`, `sales`)
    - Example:
        - `dim_customers` → Dimension table for customer data.
        - `fact_sales` → Fact table containing sales transactions.

### Glossary of Category Patterns

| Pattern  | Meaning | Example(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dim_` | Dimension table | `dim_customer`, `dim_product` |
| `fact_` | Fact table | `fact_sales` |
| `agg_` | Aggregated table | `agg_customers` , `agg_sales_monthly` |

# Column Naming Conventions

---

## Surrogate Keys

- All primary keys in dimension tables must use the suffix `_key`. This usually used in the gold layer.
- `<table_name>_key`
    - `<table_name>`: Refers to the name of the table or entity the belongs to.
    - `_key`: A suffix indicating that this column is a surrogate key.
    - Example: `customer_key` → Surrogate key in the `dim_customers` table.

## Technical Columns

- All technical columns must start with the prefix `dwh_`, followed by a descriptive name indicating the column’s purpose.
- `dwh_<column_name>`
    - `dwh`: Prefix exclusively for system-generated metadata.
    - `<column_name>`: Descriptive name indicating the column’s purpose.
    - Example: `dwh_load_date`→ System generated column used to store the date when the record was loaded.

## Stored Procedure

- All stored procedures used for loading data must follow the naming pattern:
- `load_<layer>`
    - `<layer>`: Represents the layer being loaded, such as bronze, silver, or gold.
    - Example:
        - `load_bronze` → Stored procedure for loading data into the Bronze Layer.
        - `load_silver` → Stored procedure for loading data into the Silver Layer.
